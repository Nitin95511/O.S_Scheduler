- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**  
- **Priority Scheduling**  
- **Round Robin (RR)**  

### Disk Scheduling Algorithms  
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**  
- **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**  
- **SCAN**  
- **C-SCAN**  
- **LOOK**  
- **C-LOOK**  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**  

## Purpose  
This simulator is built to:  
- Help students and educators visualize and understand the real-world implications of different scheduling algorithms.  
- Enable easy comparison and evaluation of scheduling strategies through an interactive interface.
